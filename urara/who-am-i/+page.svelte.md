## Me

As-salāmu ‘alaykum, I am a 22 years old university student from Lahore, Pakistan. Doing Bachelor in Computer Science (BSCS).

## What I want to do

For the past couple of months I've been hearing about all the things going on in Palestine. CocaCola, Google, Unilever, KFC, McDonald's, StarBucks and many more funding Israel to genocide innocent children and women. Another thing was going on my mind, that how much power does these organisations holds. Almost Everthing we are using, eating, wearing, are either manufactured or researched by them. Meta (formerly know as Facebook), has access to everything we do. More about this in last section I don't want to bore some of you. I'm pretty sure many of us are supporting Palestine, boycotting different products, donating, and most important thing - remembering them in our Dua's. For now I want to create an organization, that will build different businesses and most of the profit will be donated to Palestine and rest of it will be used to grow it, from local to multi-national to international Insha Allah. Everything will posted online, to some website. All the stats, earning, profits, expenditure etc. 

I might not be able achieve this. But my friend said to me once "We should do what we can, maybe on the day of Judgement our name will be on the list helpers. Even if written at the end".

On the authority of Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say, “Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then [let him change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart — and that is the weakest of faith.”
[Muslim]

Hadith 34, 40 Hadith an-Nawawi - [Link](https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:34)

## Why

During past these year in University I came across many people. Polical, Nerds, Social worker, Religious and many more. With the blessing of Allah I become somewhat mixure of them. Amid all of this chaos in Palestine and Pakistan too, and most of the things being in the hands of corrupts or some psychopath non-Muslims, I started to think about my ummah. I thought about many thing, and to be frank all of them are bit unrealistic. But who had thought in 10<sup>th</sup> century that there will be mobile phones, computers and internet. Maybe after some generations it all work out. As Allama Iqbal once said:

> نہیں ہے نا امید اقبال اپنی کشتِ ویراں سے

> ذرا نم ہو تو، یہ مٹی بہت زرخیز ہے ساقی

"Iqbal, do not lose hope in your barren field. If it becomes a little moist, this soil is very fertile, O cupbearer"

Almost everything from single bit to big social networks are owned by non-muslims. If something happen they can block us easily. Imagine Google or Microsoft banning its services for us. No search engine, no emails, no map, just with some clicks. We comsumer hold no authority. Even if they were to go against their term and condition I believe we can't do anything. UN demanded isreal to stop bombing Palestine, everyone know its still going on. What can we do? I just want us to hold on to something. We should atleast be self-sufficient. I don't know how, but there are millions of Muslim with more intelligent than me. They can do it. I just want to create an organization of thinkers, where they will be valued. And if you are one of them help me. 

## Meta spying on us

Meta (Formerly known as Facebook) owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. I can't say that Meta is spying on us because of lack of proof but as a IT student I can tell you it can. Every information, the post you liked, the comment you did, the chat you do with your friend, and everything you do. Meta can access it. How? Simple, everything is stored in there databases. And who has access to databases, they.

## Info for some IT specialist

I know after reading above info, some of you might say that they have it all encrypted. except for message It is really hard to encrypt other data, like post you liked and comments. Because everyone can see these. I can see on a post weather you liked it or not. So, decrypting is not a easy task (compututionally). And messages, well if you are trying to prove they encrypt our message, how will you prove it, do you have access to their backend code?, I dont think there is any way to know that our messages are indeed encrypted.

## Must Read

I am just a human. I can make mistakes If you find something that is wrong. Tell me I'd appricaite it.
